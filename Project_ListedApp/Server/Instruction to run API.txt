Steps to run the API are as follows (dont include the ' ')
But I dont suggest trying it :)

- Open CMD and CD to the project directory
- run 'npm install' to get node-modules dependencies downloaded
- run 'node server' to run the API
- it should now say API running on port 8080

*CAUTION*
This will only work locally, and with minimal functionality without 
additional steps.

- to access an Node.js API on the public internet, 
you must use your router's/firewall's port forwarding abilities. 
Node.js cant run on reserved system ports (<1024 like port 80 or 443 - http/https)

- the API is set up with a SQL Express DB config that wont exist on your
personal machines, any API calls that access the DB will fail.
