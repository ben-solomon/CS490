Below outlines the general steps for browsing the site ('behind the scenes'),
which should help highlight the architecture design. 

**In production, this would be running over HTTPS**

1) User opens web browser and navigates to http://listed.ddns.net

2) Firewall behind Server sees this request on port 80, and is 
   forwarded to Server - IIS then handles the web request, and returns
   client html, css and js files

3) User is presented with Login page, and types in username and password.
   This in turns triggers the first Ajax call - a POST request to check
   if user and pass are valid in the Database. 

4) If it is valid, a JSON Web Token is returned to the user and stored in the 
   client's machine (cookie or browser storage). All subsequent API calls must 
   include this token, else the user is redirected back to the login page.
   This works similarly to API Keys in general.

5) As the user naviagates the site, different Ajax calls will be made to bring 
   the page to life (e.g as a user changes pinboards from the dropdown, all the respective 
   lists on the pinboard automatically populate on the screen, without a page reload).
   Ajax + the REST API allow the Website to act like a 'Webapp'
