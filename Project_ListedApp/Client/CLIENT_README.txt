The client files are simple HTML/CSS/JS files, the front 
end could be anything, though (e.g React, Angular etc). 
The only thing the client does is consume the Node.JS API
via Ajax async calls. The client will work like a hybrid web app,
that is a mix of multiple HTML pages with single-page-application 
behavior (e.g statefullness).
